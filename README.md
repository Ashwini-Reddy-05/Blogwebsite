# Blogwebsite
This is a simple Blog web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the basic structure of the blog, including a header section, a container to display blog posts, and a footer section. The CSS file (blog.css) is used to design a clean and readable layout with proper spacing, typography, and styling for the blog content. The JavaScript file (blog.js) adds functionality by dynamically loading and displaying blog posts in the page. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, dynamic content rendering, and creating a simple and user-friendly web interface.
